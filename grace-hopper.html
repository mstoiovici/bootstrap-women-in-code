          <p class="text-left">
            Hopper attempted to enlist in the Navy during World War II but was rejected because she was 34 years old. She instead joined the Navy Reserves. </p>
          <p class="text-center">

            She began her computing career in 1944 when she worked on the Harvard Mark I team led by Howard H. Aiken.</p>


          <p class="text-left">
            In 1949, she joined the Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation and was part of the team that developed the UNIVAC I computer. At Eckert–Mauchly she began developing the compiler. She believed that a programming language based on English was
            possible. Her compiler converted English terms into machine code understood by computers.</p>


          <p class="text-center">

            By 1952, Hopper had finished her program linker (originally called a compiler), which was written for the A-0 System.</p>



          <p class="text-left">

            In 1954, Eckert–Mauchly chose Hopper to lead their department for automatic programming, and she led the release of some of the first compiled languages like FLOW-MATIC.
            In 1959, she participated in the CODASYL consortium, which consulted Hopper to guide them in creating a machine-independent programming language. This led to the COBOL language, which was inspired by her idea of a language being based on
            English words.</p>
          <p class="text-center">

            In 1966, she retired from the Naval Reserve, but in 1967, the Navy recalled her to active duty. She retired from the Navy in 1986 and found work as a consultant for the Digital Equipment Corporation, sharing her computing experiences.

          </p>

          <p class="text-left">Owing to her accomplishments and her naval rank, she was sometimes referred to as <em>"Amazing Grace"</em>. </p>
          <p class="text-center">The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Hopper was named for her, as was the Cray XE6 "Hopper" supercomputer at NERSC.</p>
          <p class="text-left">During her lifetime, Hopper was awarded 40 honorary degrees from universities across the world. A college at Yale University was renamed in her honour.</p>

          <p class="text-center">
            In 1991, she received the National Medal of Technology.

            On November 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama.
